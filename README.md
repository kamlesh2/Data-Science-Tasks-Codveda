Data Sources: Wikipedia, local CSVs, Yahoo Finance, Fashion MNIST .ubyte files

ðŸ”¹ Level 1: Basic
âœ… Task 1: Web Scraping
Objective: Scrape Oscar-winning film data from Wikipedia 
Result:

Extracted 150+ films from 1964â€“2024

Fields: Title, Awards, Nominations, Year

Saved to oscar_wikipedia_films.csv


âœ… Task 2: Data Cleaning
Objective: Clean and encode scraped data for modeling 
Result:

Final dataset shape: (1276, 4)

Standardized Awards, Nominations, and Year

Encoded Title using label encoding

Saved to cleaned_dataset.csv

âœ… Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Explore relationships and distributions 
Result:

Awards distribution is right-skewed

Weak positive correlation between Awards and Nominations

Title encoding not analytically meaningful

Dataset ready for modeling

ðŸ”¹ Level 2: Intermediate
âœ… Task 1: Regression
Objective: Predict gold prices using regression models 
Result:

Best Model: Random Forest

RMSE: â‚¹2,193 | RÂ²: 0.9863

Forecast (2026â€“2030): â‚¹104,569 each year

Linear Regression underperformed due to non-linearity

âœ… Task 2: Classification
Objective: Predict wine quality using classification models 
Result:

Best Model: Random Forest

Accuracy: 90% | AUC: 0.9425

Logistic Regression: 86.6% accuracy, low recall

SVM: High precision, low recall

Class imbalance impacted recall
